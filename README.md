# Ride-Sharing
A MVP of a ride sharing app, like Uber of Lyft.

Could someone make their own minimally viable version of Uber or Lyft in a weekend? **You bet they can.** 

Lyft and Uber are worth millions of dollars but the concept behind their, and other ride sharing apps is, in many ways quite simple. That’s part of it’s power. As an absolute minimum viable product (MVP), there is nothing too technologically challenging behind ride-sharing apps. I often told friends and colleagues that, if someone wanted to, they could make their own ride sharing app in just a weekend. I decided to call myself out on that claim. And this is the working result.

# Brief Summary <br />
As a passenger, you can request a pickup from drivers near you.
As a driver, wait for nearby passengers to request rides. For every pickup request, each nearby rider has the option to “accept” the pickup or “pass” the opportunity.

# Notice

Uber is a trademark of Uber Technologies. 
Lyft is a trademark of Lyft Inc.

This code is not a product, service or business offering of any sort.

Thanks to the ubiquitousness of their service, I simply use the terms “Uber” and “Lyft” to help describe some of what my code does. I am in no way affiliated with Uber Technologies or Lyft Inc. I claim no ownership of their trademarked, patented, proprietary or trade secret technologies. They have not endorsed my usage of their trademarks to help describe what this code does. Like Xerox, Google and Kleenex, these companies have created such great products that they have entered the average lexicon. If there are any problems with my usage, I’m more than happy to change it. Thank you for your understanding.
